Hi! I'm Sasha.

I'm a researcher in ethical Artificial intelligence (AI), working at [HuggingFace](huggingface.co/) to pave the way towards a better understanding of the societal and environmental impacts of AI technologies.

I am also a Board Member of [Women in Machine Learning (WiML)](wimlworkshop.org/), and a founding member of [Climate Change AI (CCAI)](climatechange.ai/), a global initiative that aims to catalyze impactful work and build a community at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.

I was previously a postdoc at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), working with [Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio) on AI and climate change, and an advisor to the [United Nations Global Pulse](https://www.unglobalpulse.org/).

In a past life, I worked in Applied AI at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/) and [Nuance Communications](https://www.nuance.com/index.html).

You can contact me at: sasha.luccioni(at)huggingface.co or follow me on ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/SashaMTL).
