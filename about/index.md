I get excited about the intersection of science and real world problems.

I'm a scientific nomad, having worked in basic neuroscience, psychiatry,
radiology, finance, and user engagement with big tech. As I learn more about
science, find myself compelled to explore new fields and build bridges between
disciplines. For me, science is only a piece of the puzzle, and I'm facinated
by all of the steps required to bring a prototype into production.

Long term, I'm most interested in use of AI to power new biomedical
breakthroughs, and to discover new technologies to fight climate change. But I
inevitably find myself working on other projects that interest me along the way.

I'm also an amateur photographer and musician, and I've peppered some of my
work throughout the site. You can check out my
[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/josephdviviano/) and
[soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jdvi) for more.

I'd love to connect if you're working on something new!
