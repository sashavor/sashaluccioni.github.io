I get excited about the intersection of science and real world problems.

I'm a scientific nomad, having worked in basic neuroscience at
[York University](http://www.yorku.ca/grturner/facilities.html),
psychiatry at [CAMH](http://www.camh.ca/), radiology with
[Imagia](https://imagia.com/),
finance with the [CDPQ](https://www.cdpq.com/en),
applied machine learning research with [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/),
and user engagement with
[Google](https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/31/google-calls-its-smart-ad-relevance-system-smart-ass-yes-seriously/).

As I learn more about science, find myself compelled to explore new fields and
build bridges between disciplines. For me, science is only a piece of the
puzzle, and I'm facinated by all of the steps required to bring a prototype
into production. You can see the scope of my work on
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jd7wEJ8AAAAJ&hl=en)
or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephdviviano/).

Long term, I'm most interested in use of AI to power new biomedical
breakthroughs, and to discover new technologies to fight climate change. But I
inevitably find myself working on other projects that interest me along the way.

I'm also an amateur photographer and musician, and I've peppered some of my
work throughout the site. You can check out my
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/josephdviviano/) and
[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jdvi) for more.
