ML can be used to find neurologically-distinct subtypes of schizophrena.

Simultaneously with the project on predicting disease trajectory for those at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, I was helping the lab manage the [Social Processes Initiative in Neurobiology of the Schizophrenia's (SPINS)](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/45/Supplement_2/S144/5434549) study. During my 4 years at the [Centre for Addiction and Mental Health](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/campbell-family-mental-health-research-institute/research-focus-campbell-institute/kimel-family-translational-imaging-genetics-lab), I spent a lot of my time managing the MRI and clinical data collected by the the three hospitals involved in the study. Briefly, the study was designed to explore the neurological underpinnings of social processing deficits seen in some subtypes of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is an interesting disease: there are many subtypes, and each of them have very different symptoms and treatments. The optimal treatment varies a lot between individuals. These patterns are largely true for all psychiatric disorders, which led to the [Research Domain Criterion (RDoC)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc.shtml) framework for mapping genomics and neurological information like brain circuits to behavioural measures. The underlying goal of the research direction is to understand the brain-behaviour relationships across diseases, to potentially identify neurologically-distinct subtypes of each disease that might be more indicative of the appropriate treatment than the diagnostic label. In my final year with the team, I ran a preliminary study using the data to evaluate the relationships between the fMRI data collected during the study and the behavioural scores. We focused on social processing because these behavioural scores are strong predictors of "functional outcomes": how well a schizophrenia patient will recover with treatment. Unfortunately, outcomes are highly variable.
